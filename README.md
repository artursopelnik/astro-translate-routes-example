# Translate routes in Astro with [Content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), subpage, optional [trailingSlash](https://docs.astro.build/de/reference/configuration-reference/#trailingslash) and [base](https://docs.astro.build/de/reference/configuration-reference/#base) support without using third-party libraries.
